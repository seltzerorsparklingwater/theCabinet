This is a work-in-progress single page web app built to give skincare fanatics the abilty to share their daily routines, view and like others daily routines, and search and explore for others skincare lovers around them. 

The app is built on Rails 6.0, and currently has a fully functioning back-end with a PostgreSQL database and several Ruby gems. Associations are shepherded with Active Record and the design is MVC Model View Controller. While the front end is not yet built, it envisions a build out with Javascript and React, utilizing npm and the now built-in (to Rails 6.0) wepback for bundling. 

Additional anticipated features are incorporation of a third party API for hosting photos and a webcrawling functionality to link to vendors where users can purchase products mentioned in posts.
